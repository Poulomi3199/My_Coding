<u><h3>Colour guidelines, as per your home section</h3></u>
<p>Experts point out that each section of your home, requires colours as per its energy requirement, size and direction. The colour requirement of your home section, should be as per its usage. Astro-numerologist, Gauravv Mittal, says, "People living in a home should keep the following points in mind, while colouring the rooms:
Master bedroom: Ideally, the master bedroom should be in a south-west direction and hence, should be painted with blue colour.<br>

<b>Guest room/ drawing room:</b> North-west is the best place for the guest room/ drawing room and hence, a guest room in this direction should be painted with white colour.<br>
<b>Kids' room: </b>North-west is the best place for rooms for children who are grown up and go out for study purposes. As the north-west direction is governed by the moon, hence, children's rooms in this direction should be painted with white colour.<br>

<b>Kitchen:</b> The south-east zone is ideal for kitchens and hence, the walls of the kitchen should be painted with orange or red colour.<br>

<b>Bathroom:</b> North-west is the best place for bathroom and hence, the bathroom should be painted with white colour.<br>

<b>Hall:</b> Ideally, the hall should be in the north-east or north-west direction and hence, should be painted yellow or white.<br>

<b>Home exterior colour:</b> The exterior colour of the house, should be based on its owners. Colours, such as yellowish-white or off-white or light mauve or orange, can suit to people of all Rashis."<br>

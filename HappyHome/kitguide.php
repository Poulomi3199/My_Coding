<font color="white"><u><h3>How To Plan The Kitchen</h3></u>
<font size="4">
<p>The planning and design of a kitchen is dependent on layout and organization of various elements. The more you plan your requirements, priorities and your way of working, the better kitchen design ideas you will get. Discuss with your family members listing out all the things you can think of. Then start planning each one by one.<br>
First see how much space you have and what type of plan you prefer. Do you have a separate room as a kitchen or an open plan integrated with living and dining areas?<br>The size and shape of the kitchen dictates its design. Do you have large area dedicated for kitchen or just a small space? Not that small space cannot be designed efficiently and made into a great kitchen. Clever planning can overcome any space limitation.
When it comes to planning, divide your kitchen into different work areas. The overall distance among the three major activity zones - cooking hob, sink and freezer should not be too much. The preferred total distance of this work triangle is eight meters. The most important work space lies between the hob and the sink. Have the main food preparation area there. </p>

<p>Depending on various factors like room configuration, size and shape of kitchen, location of doors, windows and plumbing fixtures, usages, the
required storage etc. different kitchen layouts are possible for maximum space optimization. These are -
<b>Single-Line:</b> Suitable for narrow rooms and for one or two people to use at once.
<b>Gallery:</b>Two worktops parallel to one another with a passage in-between. It provides the most efficient use of space.
<b>L-Shaped:</b> When the worktop is along the two adjacent walls. It works well with a sitting area that is integrated into the same room.
<b>U-Shaped:</b> When the worktops use the three walls of a room space. It is an efficient layout which offers maximum work space and storage.
<b>Island:</b> An island is introduced into a bigger U-shaped or L-shaped kitchen to give more compact work triangle. It is suitable for large rooms with a lot of space. </p>

<p>Once you have sorted out your kitchen design ideas, considered the basics of kitchen planning and finalized its layout, you can begin to think about the kitchen as a room in its own right. At this stage, begin to determine <i> kitchen colors, patterns and textures</i>. Start developing the decorative palette.</p>
<font size="4">
<font color="white"><u><h3>Colors</h3></u>
<p>In the kitchen, as in any interior space, color can be used to enhance the effect of natural light. Light, airy backgrounds make a space seems brighter. More spacious, richer tones provide a sense of cosy enclosure. Accent colors on a single wall can highlight the chosen elements and add a sense of interest.</p>

<h3>Textures</h3></u>
<p>Texture can also be used in a variety of ways to add interest to the kitchen. Cooking is an activity which uses a lot of touch and feel. This increases our awareness of texture in the surfaces we come in contact with. The more subdued the colors, the greater the emphasis on texture should be there to provide a sense of depth and character. For richness of textures, either of these surfaces or a combination of them can be used to complement the colors -
<i>Reflective Surfaces - Stainless Steel, Glass, Glazed Ceramic Tiles etc.
Matt Surfaces - Wood, Stone etc.</i></p>

<h3>Lighting</h3></u>
<p>Lighting is a very important element of kitchen design ideas. First of all, try to have as much natural light as possible. Then concentrate on the artificial light required for the kitchen. The colors, textures and materials choosen for different surfaces will affect the quality of light. Light colors reflect light and dark colors absorb it. So you need to provide the light accordingly. The size, shape and layout of the kitchen will also determine the amount, type and quality of light required.</p>

<h3>How To Integrate The Storage In The Kitchen</h3></u>
<p>A kitchen which looks great but does not have sufficient storage will not function properly. You can never have enough storage, no matter how big your kitchen is. Not having enough storage is less to do with lack of space in the kitchen and more due to improper planning and bad organization. Furniture is also becoming more and more a part of the kitchen design ideas as kitchen is evolving into a place to eat, entertain and relax.

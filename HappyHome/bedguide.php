					Color along with lighting is an important element for bedroom design ideas. It helps create the right ambience and atmosphere in the room. The use of colors will depend on many factors like the size and volume of the room, the amount of natural light it is getting, the effect you want to create, your personal preferences etc. The colors you choose should complement the overall decor of the room.

				<p>
					We need a relaxed and cozy ambience in the bedroom. The lighting plays an important role in creating that. It can set the tone for the room which will help you unwind after a hard days work. Lighting is the bridge that creates a transition between totally awake state to deep sleep. Let it be a smooth transition. Apart from the ambient lighting you need specific task lighting for different requirements like dressing and grooming, retrieving things from the wardrobes, drawers and shelves, reading and so on. Make sure that enough lighting is provided to take care of all these needs. Accent lighting can enhance the decor of your bedroom by highlighting the artwork, special paints or textures on a wall, accent furniture, displays or any other decorative features.

					Style, comfort and relaxation are the key factors while finalizing the furniture for your bedroom. It should be such that it fulfills all your needs, maximizing the use of space, without overcrowding the room. The bedroom furniture includes everything from the bed, dresser, chest of drawers to the storage furniture.While decorating, often people focus on the more public rooms, like living room, neglecting the bedroom. Here you spend the most private moments of your life. The room should make you feel happy and relaxed. There should be a personal touch to it. Decorating it is the easiest way to achieve that.

				<p>
					The treatment of windows is quite important to the overall bedroom design ideas. The styles and fabrics used for this purpose should not only blend in
					and harmonize with the overall decor of the room but should enhance it. The window treatment will depend on -<i>
					the overall size of the room, the size of windows, the type of decor in the room, the amount of natural light coming in, outside environment etc.</i>
					Different window treatments like drapes, curtains and blinds can be used separately or in combination to cover the windows.

				<p>
					Every bedroom needs a lot of storage to make it clean, neat and organized.
					Storage requirements are usually of different types in a bedroom. These are hanging, drawers and shelf space. You need to see the total requirement for each type of storage and then provide it accordingly as -<i>
					wardrobes, drawers, wall units, open shelves etc.</i>
